# Testing React Component Libraries

This repository compares the same implementation against different component libraries in react.

## What's implemented

The page should contain the following things:

- a form
- a menu
- a pageable result set in grid and list form
- breadcrumbs

## What's evaluated

To evaluate the libraries, we will analyse the DX while implementing (documentation, easy to understand and adapt, etc.) and the
possiblity to stay within the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) with the default components. We will not try to force designs
with the libraries that were not intended. The results can be, ofcourse, opinionated.

## Packages

- [Ant-Design](./packages/ant-design) - from [https://ant.design](https://ant.design/)
